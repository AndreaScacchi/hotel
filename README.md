# Hotel website(The Galaxy)

## What about this project?
This is a simple project that represent an Hotel website with many features, like an animated home, an about section, a services section, an accomodations section and also a contact section.

## Technologies
I've used *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* where I validated the email for the newsletter, and I took images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/it/) and I've used a [Favicon](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) logo as well.
I've used also [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to style the name of the Hotel.
